# Driver Drowsiness Alert System
=======
# Awake
Nowadays drowsiness of drivers is one of the main reasons behind road accidents. It is natural for the drivers who take long drives to doze off behind the steering wheel. In this article, we build a drowsiness detection and alert system that will alert the driver as soon as he fell asleep.

# Working Of Our Idea
Driver Drowsiness Alert System: Using an IR sensor, relay module, GSM SIM900-A, Arduino Uno, gear motor, step-down converter, and glasses with IR sensor, this project detects driver eye closure. When the driver's eyelids close, a 2-second timer starts, and an alarm alerts the driver. The wheel's speed is reduced via the relay module, and after 3 beeps, the vehicle stops using the brakes. Alerts are sent to the driver's contacts , enhancing road safety.
